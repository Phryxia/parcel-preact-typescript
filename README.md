# parcel + preact + typescript boilerplate

Since so many informations about this combination are shattered, so I want to keep them in pretty box. Note that this is almost minimal configuration. It's just for idea prototyping.

- parcel v2.4.1
- preact v10.7.1
- typescript v4.6.3

Also added prettier because I always use this.

- prettier

Actually I don't recommend to use parcel for production or complex project. It still has lots of problems like `postcss` plugin version collisions... and If you want to use TypeScript, eventually you make `tsconfig.json` properly.
